(Christmas) the snow's coming down
(Christmas) I'm watching it fall
(Christmas) watching the people around
(Christmas) baby, please come home

(Christmas) the church bells in town
(Christmas) they're ringing a song
(Christmas) oh, the happiest sound
(Christmas) baby, please come home

They're singing Deck the Halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

(Christmas) pretty lights on the tree
(Christmas) and I'm watching 'em shine
(Christmas) you should be here with me
(Christmas) baby, please come home (Christmas, Christmas)
(Christmas, Christmas)

They're singing Deck the Halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

(Christmas) if there was a way
(Christmas) I'd hold back these tears
(Christmas) but it's Christmas Day
(Christmas) baby, please come home (Christmas)

Home (Christmas)
Baby, please come home (Christmas)
Baby, please come home (Christmas)
Baby, please come home (Christmas)
Home (Christmas)
Baby, please come home (Christmas)
Baby, please come home (Christmas)
Baby, please come home (Christmas)
Baby, please come home (Christmas)
(Christmas, Christmas)
